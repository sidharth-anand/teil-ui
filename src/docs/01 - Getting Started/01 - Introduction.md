# Introduction

TeilUI is the most comprehensive svelte headless low-level UI component library with an emphasis on accessibility, customisation, and developer experience.
You may utilise these components as the foundation of your design system or gradually integrate them into it. 
Unlike most UI libraries, TeilUI is built specifically with [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) compliance - both aria-attributes and keyboard navigation - in mind.

## Usage
Refer to the component documentation for component wise usage instructions. 
As a general rule, all components are designed to be uncontrolled and can be controlled if necessary by binding to the value.
